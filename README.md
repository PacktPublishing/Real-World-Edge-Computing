## Get to Know the Authors
**Robert High**
retired in 2023, after 42 years at IBM. He is currently doing independent freelancing. Prior to his retirement, Rob was IBM Fellow, Vice President, and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for IBM’s Edge Computing and Networking business. He had architecture and technical strategy responsibility for offerings that will enable a new generation of edge computing – where work is placed close to where data is produced, and actions are performed – and enterprise networking for connecting edge and hybrid Cloud locations. Prior to that assignment, he was the CTO for IBM Watson, responsible for setting the technical strategy and vision for IBM’s leadership in AI computing. High is recognized as a global technical leader, author, and evangelist, and was named an IBM Fellow in 2008 for his pioneering work in the field of SOA and his leadership on WebSphere.

**Sanjeev Gupta**
currently edge computing lead for IBM’s Software Networking division, commands a holistic view of why edge computing is needed and how a practical scalable edge solution can be put together with modern container technologies. Having spent nearly four decades in diverse industries ranging from semiconductor, networking, application business process development and automation, and his own multiple start-ups for mobile and IoT applications, he understands the cycle of the ever-evolving technological landscape. He has always been an engineer focused on turning hype into reality. Along the way, he has been encouraged by many colleagues and friends – in particular, Glen Darling, Joe Pearson, Dave Booz, and Carl Girouard, who entrusted him to make significant contributions to the Open Horizon edge computing platform and related networking products.
